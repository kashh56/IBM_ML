# Rain Prediction Classifier 🌧️☀️

## Project Overview 🌟

Welcome to the Rain Prediction Classifier project! This Honors Project is designed to enhance your machine learning skills by applying various classification algorithms to a real-world dataset. Your task is to predict whether it will rain the following day using data from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## Project Scenario 📊

After five weeks of mastering different machine learning algorithms through the **IBM Machine Learning course on Coursera**, you now have the opportunity to practice what you've learned. In this project, you will:

*   **Clean** the rainfall dataset.
*   **Build** classifiers using multiple algorithms.
*   **Evaluate** the performance of each classifier.

## Dataset 📈

You will use a rainfall dataset sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.
## Algorithms Used 🤖

You are expected to implement the following algorithms:

1.  **Linear Regression**
2.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3.  **Decision Trees**
4.  **Logistic Regression**
5.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Evaluation Metrics 📏

The performance of each classifier will be reported using the following metrics:

*   **Accuracy Score** ✅
*   **Jaccard Index** 📐
*   **F1-Score** 🌟
*   **Log Loss** 📉
*   **Mean Absolute Error** 📏
*   **Mean Squared Error** 📊
*   **R² Score** 📈
